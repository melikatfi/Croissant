    <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France.
        <br>
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.
        <br>
        The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating.
        <br>
        The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
        <br>
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
        <br>
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
